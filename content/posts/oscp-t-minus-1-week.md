I get access to the PWK course material in a week, so I figured I'd write up a quick post about how I've been preparing.

After I registered for the course I read through [the syllabus](https://www.offensive-security.com/documentation/penetration-testing-with-kali.pdf) and made note of the areas in which I was least confident.  The main topics that jumped out at me were buffer overflows and web application attacks. I did some searching and found some great resources.

[This post on abatchy's blog](https://www.abatchy.com/2017/03/how-to-prepare-for-pwkoscp-noob) has been a huge help, and it led me to the [first post in the Corelan series](https://www.corelan.be/index.php/2009/07/19/exploit-writing-tutorial-part-1-stack-based-overflows/) on buffer overflows. Combined with the [dostackbufferoverflowgood lesson on Github](https://github.com/justinsteven/dostackbufferoverflowgood) I feel like I at least have enough of a grasp on things to work through the PWK BO material.

As for web application attacks, I plan to follow abatchy's advice and see how far I can get with [Overthewire: Natas](http://overthewire.org/wargames/natas/) over the next few days.

Outside of preparing for the course content, I still need to decide on how I'll be handling my notes throughout the class/lab/exam.  I will probably run the PWK Kali VM on my Windows 10 machine.  It's a 17" laptop with a beefier processor and more RAM than my ThinkPad (running Ubuntu), so I may go with OneNote over CherryTree within the Kali VM.

[This Electron app](https://github.com/patrikx3/onenote) makes it pretty easy to use OneNote on Linux. That would give me a backup option if I run into clipboard issues between the Windows host and the PWK Kali image, or if the OneNote web app has problems in Kali (which I've run into before).

I'm looking forward to getting started and plan to post somewhat regular updates here to track my progress.
