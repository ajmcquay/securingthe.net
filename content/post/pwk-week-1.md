I started working on Offensive Security's _[Penetration Testing with Kali Linux](https://www.offensive-security.com/information-security-training/penetration-testing-training-kali-linux/)_ (PWK) course last weekend, and thought I'd write a quick post to recap my progress so far.

Most sources I've come across recommend going through all of the reading, videos, and course exercises before tackling lab machines, so I decided to go that route.  In the first week I finished the reading and videos through chapter 9, and completed exercises through chapter 7.  Here's a quick breakdown of how I spent my time each day:

{{< figure src="/content/images/2019/03/Screen-Shot-2019-03-24-at-8.09.53-PM.png" >}}

### Day 1

* Watched videos for chapters 1 & 2
* Read chapter 1, half of chapter 2
* Completed exercises for chapter 1, half of chapter 2

### Day 2

* Finished chapter 2 reading & exercises. Watched chapter 3 videos

### Day 3

* Completed videos & reading for chapters 3 & 4
* Completed chapter 3 exercises, half of chapter 4

### Day 4

* Completed videos & reading through chapter 7
* Completed exercises through chapter 4
* Wrote a couple of python scripts to automate tasks from chapter 4
* Set up private git repo for any scripts I create as I go through the course work (I really, really recommend this!)

### Day 5

* Completed chapter 5 exercises
* Resolved issues with OpenVAS scans not starting
* Caught up on sleep, wanted to tackle buffer overflow content over the weekend

### Day 6

* Completed chapter 8 reading, exercises for chapters 6 & 7

The buffer overflow content has been the highlight so far, but I was already pretty familiar with everything in the first five chapters.  Tonight I'll wrap up BO content and start my second week.  I'm hoping to finish the course work this week and have the rest of my lab time (60 days) to work through the lab machines.
