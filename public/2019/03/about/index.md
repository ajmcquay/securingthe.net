# About


I am an infosec professional with a background in networking (routing & switching, DSL/WAN) and Linux administration. I spent the last few years running a PCI-DSS compliance program and starting a blue team practice for my previous employer. Now I'm involved in risk management and information assurance, but hope to get back into the technical bits of information security again in the next few years.

I'm interested in topics like network forensics, threat hunting, penetration testing, and malware analysis/reverse engineering.  I currently hold the OSCP, CISSP, and CISA certifications. I'd like to learn more Python too, eventually.

I also play delay pedals with my guitar and make noise with friends under the moniker [_After Osmosis_](https://afterosmosis.bandcamp.com).
