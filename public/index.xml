I spent the last few years running a PCI-DSS compliance program and starting a blue team practice for my previous employer. Now I&amp;rsquo;m involved in risk management and information assurance, but hope to get back into the technical bits of information security again in the next few years.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m interested in topics like network forensics, threat hunting, penetration testing, and malware analysis/reverse engineering. I currently hold the OSCP, CISSP, and CISA certifications. I&amp;rsquo;d like to learn more Python too, eventually.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I also play delay pedals with my guitar and make noise with friends under the moniker &lt;a href="https://afterosmosis.bandcamp.com">&lt;em>After Osmosis&lt;/em>&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
